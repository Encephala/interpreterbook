Some ideas for future me:
- Add line numbers to lexer and pass through to evaluation for nice error messages
- Implement rust's `as` syntax and disallow implicit typecasting
- Turn let statements and return statements into expressions
- Let every block expression have its own scope rather than just functions
- Is it possible/feasible to check for existence of variables used in function when it is defined, rather than when
it is executed?
- GC?
- Error handling in lexer
    - No closing apostrophe for Str
- Don't allow a variable being set to Null
